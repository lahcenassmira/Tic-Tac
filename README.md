#Tic Tac Toe Game


A simple and classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in javaScript. This project provides a two-player console-based game where players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The first player to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol wins the game.

Features

Interactive Console Interface: User-friendly console interface for a seamless gaming experience.
Winning Logic: The game checks for a winner after each move and declares the victorious player.
